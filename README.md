StudyJS (help me find a better name!)
===================

This is a simple desktop application built with electron. It allows you to create structured summaries of your school matter.

You might know me from a reddit post:

You can find the roadmap here:

`npm start`  


Building

To build for your OS, run this command  
`npm run release`  

Contributing
-------------

You can contribute to this project if you want, but the code is not very optimized and readable, so it might be better to wait with contributions.
